    "# Sumarizador Automático de Texto usando Embeddings \n",
    "A proposta deste trabalho é desenvolver uma Prova de Conceito no intuito de demonstrar um sumarizador automático de texto capaz de gerar resumos extrativos de documentos usando embeddings para capturar a semântica das frases. Para os testes e avaliação, será utilizado o dataset CNN/DailyMail; ele contém artigos de notícias e seus resumos, e é amplamente utilizado para tarefas de sumarização. \n",
    "\n",
    "O pipeline de execução do sumarizador será composto, basicamente, pelas seguintes etapas: \n",
    "1. Pré-processar o texto\n",
    "2. Transformar cada frase do texto em um vetor (embedding); \n",
    "3. Aplicar clusterização nesses embeddings para agrupar frases contextualmente similares; \n",
    "4. Obter as frases mais representativas de cada cluster; \n",
    "5. Compor o resumo extrativo a partir das frases obtidas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neste trabalho serão usados os modelos de embedding da OpenAI ``text-embedding-3-small``, ``text-embedding-3-large`` e ``text-embedding-ada-002``, sendo necessário acesso a uma chave de API da OpenAI para reproduzir."

    "Para tentar evitar o problema de tentar avaliar essa solução com uma métrica ROUGE, visto que os resumos de referência ('highlights') não foram criados da mesma forma que os nossos, que são resumos extrativos, tentamos uma abordagem diferente. Optamos por utilizar os próprios embeddings para avaliação: a ideia foi usar a similaridade entre o embeddings do resumo gerado e do resumo de referência como score de avaliação. Desde que o mesmo modelo de embedding seja utilizado para todos os resumos, a similaridade (ou distância de cosseno) entre eles é uma comparação válida.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essa é uma forma de avaliação parecida com o que foi usado no ROUGE-WE, discutido no artigo \"Better Summarization Evaluation with Word Embeddings for ROUGE\", de Jun-Ping Ng e Viktoria Abrech. O ROUGE-WE é uma métrica baseada no ROUGE, mas que usa de embeddings de palavras de forma a aliviar a perda de score que se teria devido a parafraseamento do texto. Neste trabalho, no entanto, usaremos embeddings de texto completo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assim, vamos avaliar a solução conforme a média dos scores de similaridade usando os 50 primeiros artigos do dataset de treinamento do CNN/DailyMail. Vamos comparar os resultados usando 3 modelos de embeddings diferentes para sumarização do texto: o text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, e text-embedding-ada-002. Para a avaliação em si, será usado apenas o text-embedding-3-small para manter a consistência e justiça da avaliação."
